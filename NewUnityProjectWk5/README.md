My project was supposed to be a very generic maze game that has enemies in the maze along with "decoy" princess's to stop you from getting to the real princess.Originally i wanted this to be from a first person point of view but due to lack of skill i ran into problems with my player getting caught in the wall,enemy movement, player speed and many other problems i ran into with coding things in C#.

The way you play the game is by using the up,down, left and right keys to control your player and progress in the maze until you finally meet up with "princess generic" lol. once you have reached her the game is over.
