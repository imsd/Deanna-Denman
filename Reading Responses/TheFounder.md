While playing the founder i noticed that it took alot to keep my start up afloat.When I did something well and my mobile app or website did amazing, the board of directors praised me but when i failed they gave me a bail out.Ultimately i feel that i failed this game because it made me feel as though i was always on eggshells.If i decided to take a break to let the money build up, my employees would feel uninspired and begin to complain about how they didnt have any work to do, but i also didnt want to give them work because the company needed money.This game really gave me a strong amount of anxiety as a business owner and how any app/website/device/wearable i made could make or break the company.The game really gives that strong sense of capitalism and the need to be a success, eventually it became something that wasnt enjoyable at all and all of my focus was just trying to find the right pairings to get me to that profit margin.
