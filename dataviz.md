My idea for my project is to show the major eating disorders that are affecting many of the developed countries and continents around the world and what happens to these people who are effected by these poor eating habits.I have decided to focus on mainly men and women by country instead of race and see how each groups country has different ideals on what is healthy and what is not.i will be using statistics for this project due to the fact thati could not find any live data. The project will have people starting at healthy weights and by seeing their weight go up or down we will be able to determine the severity of that countries eating disorders.
